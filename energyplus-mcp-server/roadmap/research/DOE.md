**DOE **stands for the **U.S. Department of Energy**. The "DOE Commercial Reference Buildings" (also called DOE Prototype Buildings) are a set of standardized building models created by the Department of Energy and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). They represent typical U.S. commercial buildings and are used as benchmarks for:

Energy code development (ASHRAE 90.1)

Energy efficiency research

Building simulation comparisons



**Why They Matter for Your Project**

These are pre-built, validated EnergyPlus models with:

Realistic geometry and zoning

Complete HVAC systems

Typical schedules and loads

Multiple climate zone variants (16 US zones)

**The limitation**: They're US-focused and don't include manufacturing facilities or data centers as explicit prototypes. However, the Warehouse model could be adapted for light manufacturing, and there are separate BCL measures for data center HVAC components. For UK sites (Rob's catchment areas), the US climate zones won't directly apply, but the building geometry and HVAC system designs are still useful starting points that can be combined with UK weather files from PVGIS.
